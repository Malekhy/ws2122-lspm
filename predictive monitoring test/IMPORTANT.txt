1- Train a prediction model with an original data (test.csv).
2- Train another prediction model with a preprocessed data (sampled model from LSPM tool and using different sampling methods).
3- Evalute both of the resulting models with the test data from the original log.

Notes: 
-we repeated step 2 with each sampled file according to the sampling method used to sampling that file.
